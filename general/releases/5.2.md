If you are upgrading from a previous version, please see [Upgrading](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading) in the user docs.

## Server requirements

These are just the minimum supported versions. We recommend keeping all of your software and operating systems up-to-date.

- Moodle upgrade: Moodle 4.2.3 or later.
- PHP version: minimum PHP 8.3.0 *Note: minimum PHP version has increased since Moodle 4.5*. PHP 8.4.x is supported too. See [PHP](../development/policies/php.md) for details.
- PHP extension **sodium** is required. See [Environment - PHP extension sodium](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Environment_-_PHP_extension_sodium).
- PHP setting **max_input_vars** must be >= 5000. For further details, see [Environment - max input vars](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Environment_-_max_input_vars).
- PHP variants: Only 64-bit versions of PHP are supported.

### Database requirements

Moodle supports the following database servers. Again, version numbers are just the minimum supported version. We recommend running the latest stable version of any software.

| Database | Minimum version | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) | 14 (increased since Moodle 4.5) | Latest |
| [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) | 8.4 (increased since Moodle 4.5) | Latest |
| [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) | 10.11.0 (increased since Moodle 4.5) | Latest |
| [Aurora MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraMySQL.html) | [8.0](#aurora-mysql-compatibility-version) | Latest |
| [Microsoft SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) | 2017 | Latest |

Please note that Oracle Database is no longer supported from Moodle LMS 5.0.

:::note Database prefixes

Since Moodle 4.3, the maximum length for the database prefix (`$CFG->prefix`) is 10 characters. Installation or upgrade won't be possible with longer prefixes.

:::

#### Aurora MySQL compatibility version

This system requires configuration using standard MySQL version numbers (e.g., 8.0) rather than Aurora's internal versioning (e.g., 3.x) to maintain compatibility with MySQL client tools, version-dependent features, and database detection methods.

## Client requirements

### Browser support

Moodle is compatible with any standards compliant web browser. We regularly test Moodle with the following browsers:

Desktop:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Mobile:

- MobileSafari
- Google Chrome

For the best experience and optimum security, we recommend that you keep your browser up to date.
